          <div>
            <h3>Arrival</h3>
            <p>
              Our trip began at Narita International Airport, located about 60 km from Tokyo. After
              landing and completing all immigration procedures, we were greeted by the Jornada
              Viagens team, who drove us to our hotel.

            <h3>lodging</h3>
            <p>
              We stayed at the luxurious Hotel Okura Tokyo, located in the Toranomon district. The
              hotel has an incredible view of the city and offers a wide range of services,
              including a spa, a swimming pool, renowned restaurants, and a lounge bar. We were
              delighted with the attention to detail and the quality of service.

            <h3>Exploring the city</h3>
            <p>
              We began our tour of the city with a visit to the famous Sensoji Temple, one of the
              oldest and most important Buddhist temples in Japan. We walked along Nakamise shopping
              street, where we found many shops selling typical Japanese items such as kimonos,
              fans, and traditional foods. Next, we visited the iconic Shibuya Crossing, one of the
              busiest intersections in the world, where we observed the synchrony of pedestrians
              crossing the street. The next day, we visited Ueno Park, home to the Tokyo National
              Museum, where we learned about Japanese history and culture. In the evening, we went
              to a typical Izakaya, a Japanese bar that serves a wide variety of dishes and drinks.

            <h3>Shopping</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo is famous for its department stores and shopping malls, and we couldn't miss
              visiting some of them. We went to the famous Ginza shopping district, where we found
              stores selling the world's most renowned brands. We also visited the Akihabara
              district, known as Tokyo's electronics and entertainment center, where we found
              several stores selling games, electronics, and manga.

            <h3>Cuisine</h3>
            <p>
              One cannot talk about Japan without mentioning its cuisine. We had the opportunity to
              try a wide variety of typical dishes, such as sushi, sashimi, ramen, and tempura, as
              well as traditional sweets like mochi.

            <h3>In conclusion...</h3>
            <p>
              Our trip to Tokyo with Jornada Viagens was an unforgettable experience. The agency's
              team took care of every detail, from booking the hotel to choosing the best places to
              visit and eat. We recommend Jornada Viagens to anyone who wants to take an incredible
              trip to Japan.
